# Manchester Pub Crawl Using TSP

## Overview

I went for a weekend away in Manchester and wanted to go on a pub crawl, with some sightseeing stops. I used OR Tools to solve a TSP problem with the following constraints:

- I had a maximum time of 8 hours
- I wanted to start and finish at my hotel
- I will have one pint at each pub and will stop for half an hour
- I have a maximum capacity of 8 pints
- There is a fixed penalty for each pub that I do not visit
- For each sightseeing stop, there is a specific stop time and penalty for not visiting
